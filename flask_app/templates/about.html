            <p>We are a supportive platform designed to provide emotional support to those working in the healthcare field.</p>
            <p>It is often difficult to talk about the experiences one has as a healthcare worker with friends and loved ones not "in the field". We therefore created this platform to give those seeking support a place to do so with others who have a firsthand understanding of the unique struggles that can arise working in healthcare.</p>
            <p>Join today and see what true understanding and support feels like from friends who get it!</p>
            <h3>By doing so, we are Helping Helpers.</h3>
            <a href="/">Try it out Today!</a>
